/**
 * Resolve `with`/`against` names → open read-only sibling handles + the federation block (Decision 5).
 * Refusals surface in the block (attached:false); the caller warns, never silently drops. The caller
 * MUST invoke close() in a finally — sibling `.lux` handles are read-only (SC-7).
 *
 * FIX 1 (per-sibling fault isolation): opening a resolved sibling runs AFTER resolve, and the
 * long-lived MCP server has no per-request process to reap leaked handles. A post-resolve open fault
 * (a TOCTOU delete/re-index, a cross-process busy-timeout from a concurrent `lux index rebuild`, or a
 * file that passed resolve but faults on re-open) must degrade THAT sibling — not throw out of the
 * loop and leak every handle already opened in the batch. Matching the CLI's graceful degrade, the
 * faulted sibling's resolution is rewritten to a refusal so the federation block stays consistent
 * (attached:false + reason), and the loop continues with the healthy handles. Because the loop never
 * throws, the returned `close()` is always constructed and closes every opened handle.
 *
 * Extracted from the server module so this pure resolve/open logic is unit-testable (the server entry
 * connects stdio at import time and cannot be imported into a test).
