// src/scanner/embeddings/node-embed-pass.ts  (FENCED — scanner/embeddings/*)
//
// The node embed pass (T3.4): reads the needs-embedding / resume queue (persisted prepared text),
// embeds it under a wall-clock budget, upserts model-tagged vectors, and reports coverage. Runs at the
// tail of every index path (cli/index.ts, Part B of spec 16). When coverage is already complete the
// widened LEFT-JOIN queue (spec 11 db layer) returns zero rows, so the pass skips the 34 MB model load
// — not a free check (the queue read still scans structural_node_texts), but it never pays the embedder
// bring-up.
//
// It NEVER throws on a budget hit OR on an embedder/DB failure — Decision 5: a failed embed pass must
// never fail the surrounding `lux index rebuild`/`sync`. A failed pass leaves the queue exactly where
// it was (each upsert is its own committed statement) and the next index path resumes it.
//
// It prepares NOTHING and re-parses NOTHING (Re-key R1): prepareNodeText (spec 10) ran at
// MATERIALIZATION and persisted structural_node_texts.prepared + .content_hash. This pass reads that
// prepared column from the queue and embeds it. There is no node:crypto import, no scanner/anchors
// import, and no tree-sitter/LSP touch on this path.
//
// FENCED (03 §Layer & fence analysis): this module lives under src/scanner/embeddings/ and may import
// only db/*, utils/*, and its embeddings siblings. Its sole production importer is cli/index.ts
// (Part B), which is on the fence allowlist.

 * Budget shape mirrors `overlay-refresh.ts`'s LSP tier (the deadline-check + throw + single outer
 * catch + degrade-and-report idiom) exactly: a deadline computed once up front, checked before
 * starting each batch and again after finishing it, and ANY failure that reaches the outer `catch` —
 * whether the deadline sentinel or a genuinely unexpected error (an `embedder.embed()` rejection, a
 * corrupt-weights crash surfacing mid-pass, an `encodeVector` dims mismatch, a DB write failure) —
 * degrades the SAME way: stop, mark `budgetHit`, report once, return whatever was embedded before the
 * failure. Never rethrown past this function (Decision 5).
 *
 * Resume (Re-key R1): a budget-interrupted pass leaves un-embedded rows in the queue and re-reads them
 * on a later index path. It re-parses NOTHING — the `prepared` text and its `content_hash` are already
 * persisted in `structural_node_texts`; resume is a pure re-read of the queue.
