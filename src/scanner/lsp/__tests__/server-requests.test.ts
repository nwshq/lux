// Server-initiated requests must be answered, not dropped.
//
// A JSON-RPC message carrying both an `id` and a `method` is a request FROM the
// server. Before this was handled, handleMessage() looked the id up in its
// pending-request map, missed, and returned — so the server waited forever for
// a reply that was never coming. Volar issues workspace/configuration
// immediately after `initialized` and serves no documentSymbol until it is
// answered, which presented as an enricher that ran and produced nothing.
