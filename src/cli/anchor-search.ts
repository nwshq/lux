 * (invalid-query / fts-unavailable) over a POPULATED index has embedded texts, so a hardcoded zero
 * would be a false statement in the frozen schemaVersion:1 `coverage` field. For overlay-missing /
 * anchor-texts-absent the count is a genuine 0 (autoMigrate keeps the table present, so the probe is
 * always safe). Embeddings are absent in Phase 1, so embeddedNodes:0 / model:null stay hardcoded.
