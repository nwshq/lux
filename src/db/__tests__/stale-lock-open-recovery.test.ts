// A stale VFS lock must not wedge a NORMAL open — only `index rebuild` used to recover from one.
//
// node-sqlite3-wasm implements SQLite locking as a `${path}.lock` DIRECTORY, and the kernel does not
// drop it when a process dies. reclaimStaleLock() existed for exactly this, but was called from one
// site (cli/index.ts) out of 28 `new LuxDatabase(...)` opens — so search, trace, deps, overlay,
// anchors and the MCP server all died on a lock whose owner was provably gone, permanently.
//
// Observed 2026-09-02: a lock orphaned 22h with 94 dead-pid owner markers going back six weeks;
// `lux search` returned `Error: database is locked` on every invocation and could never recover.
//
// These cases pin the recovery to the OPEN path, and pin the safety rail that makes it safe there.
